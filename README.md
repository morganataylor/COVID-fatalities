# Introduction

This repository contains the code for an ongoing data analysis project to contextualize the fatalities attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.


# Requirements for Reproduction

This analysis requires R, Rmarkdown (and variants, e.g. bookdown), Github and a reference manager that can handle bibtex (e.g. Zotero). It is also requires a word processor to be installed (e.g. MS Word or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)). It is beneficial (but not technically required) to have a spreadsheet processor installed (e.g. MS Excel or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)) to read the raw data and data dictionaries.
